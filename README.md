Testing Redis high concurrency with ApacheBench

In the previous example https://www.robertobandini.it/2020/11/15/an-example-of-redis-persistence-using-node-js-and-kubernetes/ we have seen how to use Kubernetes and Docker to deploy a Node.js microservice to interact with Redis, also showing in a basic way how Redis persistence works and how to scale up applicationâ€™s microservice.

In this example we will test our application using ApacheBench.
This will show the applications behaviour when we have many requests and what happens in case of high concurrency with Redis.
